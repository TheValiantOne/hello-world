# hello-world
First Git repository

Hi Humans!

I'm TheValiantOne, and I am pretty much new to GIT. I'm learning how to create and manage code collaboratively, as I would like to move to an analyst position.

Currently, I am a consultant, but I pride myself on Prcodeural Language and SQL skills, and my ability to analyze JAVA code in my enterprise's software. I'd like to start debugging and coding, but I know that collaborative development is integral to today's software industry.
